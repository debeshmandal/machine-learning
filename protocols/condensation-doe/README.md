# Star polymer condensation
This folder contains real simulation data (`results.csv`) and python scripts to preprocess (`preprocessing.py`), create a Keras model using TensorFlow (`model.py`), and do analysis (`analyse.py`) 

The results can be viewed in the Jupyter Notebook (`condensation-ml.ipynb`)
